Typo 5.0.3 "Don Mc Cullin" released on February 2008 the 24th is mostly a bugfix and refactoring release, going along with some improvements, everything leading slowly but surely to 5.1. 

*** Less bugs, more speed ***

Honnestly, Typo has never been so fast and so bugless as well. We've rewriten most of the caching engine, and it's now running flawlessly. Our effort to speed up the code has also been pursued and we can be proud of what we're releasing.

*** Brand new editor ***

The blog editor has been rewriten too, to be more functionnal and user friendly. We've also switched the rich text editor from TinyMCE to FCKEditor for 4 important features :
– Fullscreen edition (kicks ass baby)
– Spellchecking
– Safari compatibility
– Impressive localization

*** More localisation ***

We're continuing the localization effort to port Typo in your language. Default themes has been localized, and we now provide up to 8 languages :
– English (default)
– French
– German
– Italian
– Japanese
– Mexican Spanish
– Polish
– Romanian

Many thanks to all the translators. Currently, only French translation is really complete.

*** No gem? ***

We won't provide you the habitual gem we used to. Rails app installer – formerly known as Typo installer – is brocken with Rails 2.0.2 and Typo instances installed this way just don't work. 

We hope you'll enjoy Typo 5.0.3 as much as we enjoyed bringing it to you.
