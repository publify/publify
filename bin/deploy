# Basic deploy script to help us precompile the latest assets to our CDN and deploy to our staging environment on
# Heroku.
#
# This script will generate new assets and then send them off to your CDN of choice using `assets_sync` making assets
# management a little less painful.
#
# NOTE: Make sure that you are working with a current master branch
