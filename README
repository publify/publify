What is it?
===========

Typo is a weblog system written in Ruby using Ruby on Rails. Weblogs are cool,
weblogs are "in" and everyone who writes code has an different opinion on how
a weblog should be written. Typo is our take on it. Typo is designed to be
usable by programmers and non-programmers, while being easy for programmers to
extend.

Requirements
============

Currently you need all of those things to get typo to run:

 * Ruby -v of 1.8.2 (25-05-2004) or higher 
 * Rails 0.13.1
 * A database.  Typo supports MySQL, PostgreSQL, and SQLite.
 * Ruby drivers for your database.
 * For best performance, you should have a web server running either
   Apache or Lighttpd along with FastCGI, although these aren't
   strictly required--you can use Ruby's built-in web server for
   low-volume testing.

Installation
============

Unpack the tgz or zip in some directory.

Decide which database to use. We support Sqlite, MySQL, and Postgres,
but Sqlite doesn't have full support for database migrations in Rails
0.13.1.

  * Create a database for typo. You can find schemas in the db/ folder. 
  * Create config/database.yml using database.yml.example to reflect your
    newly created database configuration  
  * Run script/server -e production and see if it works  
  * Point your browser to http://your.domain.com:3000/ and follow the
    install process

Typo, like all Rails apps, doesn't work well as a CGI. Seriously consider
using FastCGI instead. To deploy on FastCGI you will need to follow the setup
instructions on the typo page at http://typo.leetsoft.com/trac/wiki/FastCgi

By default, Typo runs in *development* mode. This is very useful for
developers, but it can cause horrible performance for users who aren't
changing Typo's code. Production mode can easily be 20x as fast as development
mode. To change the default, edit the second line of config/environment.rb and
change 'development' to 'production', or follow the directions on the FastCGI
configuration page on the Typo wiki.

Permissions
===========

Typo needs write access to several directories in order to function
correctly. These need to be writable by the user that runs the Typo
process--in a hosted environment this may be your user; on dedicated
systems it may be something like 'httpd' or 'www-data'.

The specific directories in question are 'log/' (and everything underneath
it), 'cache/', and 'public/'. Strictly speaking, Rails will continue to work
if public isn't writable, but Typo's page caching code will work properly and
this will cause Typo to be slower and use much more CPU time. For the security
conscious, Rails really only needs the ability to change a half-dozen files
and subdirectories under public/, ask on the Typo mailing list for more
details.

Usage
======

Typo's administrative interface is available at
http://your.domain.com/admin. You can use this to post articles and
change Typo's configuration settings. For posting new content, you can
either use this administrative web interface or a desktop blog editor
like MarsEdit or Ecto. For a short list of clients which are confirmed
to work please visit http://typo.leetsoft.com.

Client setup
============

Set your desktop client to Movable Type API and enter
http://your.domain.com/backend/xmlrpc as endpoint address.
