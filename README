What is it?
===========

Typo is a weblog system written in Ruby using Ruby on Rails. Weblogs are cool,
weblogs are "in" and everyone who writes code has a different opinion on how
a weblog should be written. Typo is our take on it. Typo is designed to be
usable by programmers and non-programmers, while being easy for programmers to
extend.

Requirements
============

Currently you need all of those things to get typo to run:

 * Ruby 1.8.6 or Ruby Enterprise Edition. 
 * Rails 2.2, Typo 5.3 DOES NOT support Rails 2.1.
 * A database.  Typo supports MySQL, PostgreSQL, and SQLite.
 * Ruby drivers for your database.
 * For best performance, you should have a web server running either
   Apache, Lighttpd or Nginx, along with FastCGI, mongrel or thin. You can use 
   Ruby's built-in web server for low-volume testing.
   We recommend the use of Apache + mod_rails (aka Passenger) for fast and 
   easy deployment along with speed.
 * rspec, rcov and ruby-debug are necessary to run the test suit.

Installation
============

See doc/Installer.txt and doc/typo-5.3-release-notes.txt.
