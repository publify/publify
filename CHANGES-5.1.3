Typo 5.1.3 is the fourth release of the "Cartier-Bresson" series and released on sunday August the 31th. It is mostly a bugfix and behaviour fix version, so don't expect many changes.

Bug #1244: error with postgresql database on admin/content
Bug #1251: Documentation on dashboard is 404
Bug #1252: migrations alter updated_at timestamps of articles and comments, affects RSS feeds
Bug #1253: Twice redirect in admin/user#list if no admin
Bug #1254: Fix little error when you use bad id in AdminUser#edit
Bug #1255: Doesn't autosave if no define title
Bug #1256: /article/ 301 redirect hits the default buffer which is not the expected behaviour
Bug #1257: Articles redirect doesn't work with non-nil relative_url_root


Rev #1784: Fixed requirements and added our official Typo mascot
Rev #1786: Fixes a stupid behaviour that forces tags display name to be the same as the name in the url. IE : "web 2.0" would display on a page as web2-0 after transformation, which is stupid. Adds a migration that changes '.' into '-' in tag already in the database. Otherwise, it makes typo crash when accessing that tag. Allows edition of tag display name in the admin.
Rev #1787:Removes database dependencies from installer. Now we assume you already have MySQL, PgSQL or SQLLite adater installed. Deletes 2 themes from FCKEditor, about 300k lighter now. Suppress caching from development environment
Rev #1789: Fixes a stupid bug that allows a non administrative user to change his profile
Rev #1792: Removing tmcode textfilter. It now has its own life at http://svn.typosphere.org/plugins/typo_textfilter_tmcode/. Removing amazon textfilter. It now has its own life at http://svn.typosphere.org/plugins/typo_textfilter_amazon/. Removing sparkline textfilter. It now has its own life at http://svn.typosphere.org/plugins/typo_textfilter_sparkline/
Rev #1795: Fixes 2 nasty bugs with autosave. The first one broke autosave when no title was set. We now set a default title. The second one was overriding permalink with a void string when post was autosaved because the permalink field was empty after autosave. For autosave: If no title is given, Typo gives it a title like "Article Draft + post_id". When publishing, every article-draft-something permalink is just replaced with the article title crafted permalink.
Rev #1796: Enables in admin database migration back, gets rid of the old pre 4.1 general controller, sets the CHANGELOG for 5.1.3.

Many thanks to Cyril Mougel, Matijs van Zuijlen and Frédéric Logier for submitting patches.
